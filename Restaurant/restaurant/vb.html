        <pre>It was founded in 1943 by Venketarama Ural to serve students who originally hailed from outside<br>the city who were attending the nearby Acharya Pathasala Public School and National College in<br>addition to other schools in Gandhi Bazaar, an area known for having a high concentration of<br> educational institutions. At that time, newly opened restaurants would be given names that<br> featured the word "Bhavan" (Bhavana; lit.â€‰'House') at the end, which led to the establishment<br> gaining its name.[1] Later, Parameshwara Udal took over before selling it to current owner<br> Ramakrishna Adiga in 1970.[2][3]</pre>
