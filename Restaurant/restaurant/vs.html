        <pre>It was under these circumstances that Veena Hotel was born in 1977. Named after his daughter,<br>it was born out of the compulsions of earning to keep his family going. Its location was<br>determined not by retail science but by what he could afford. ‘ A losing location’<br>is what his friends and some relatives called it. Set in a residential locality called Margosa Road<br> and away from the shopping-commercial center that Sampige Road was. A small shop even by the<br>yardstick of that time, for that was what he could afford to. His son, Pradeep who now runs the shop<br> was 9 years old then.

            But what took the cake was not that the shop was being set up in a residential area<br> away from the market, or that it was too small, or that it was born out of survival compulsions...<br>it was a shop where one had to stand and eat. That was ridiculous as the idea of eating while standing<br>was completely alien at that time. Why would anyone come to a small unknown shop far away from the market,<br>stand and eat. It seemed like a recipe for failure. Or so it seemed. “There was really no other go, let’s see...<br> God will be with us,” in Suryanarayana Rao’s words. It was an option that was born out of ‘no<br>option’. And surely not a strategy to differentiate.</pre>
